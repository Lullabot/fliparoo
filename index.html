        		<div class="tab-set">
        		
        		<p>For anyone who has tried to implement a carousel or slider on a responsive website, you know that it can be frustrating. These complex animations and interactions often don't resize or re-adapt easily to different display sizes. Although they can look great on desktop browsers, the fact that they become one big "blob" limits options for a responsive design.</p>

				<h2 class="orange">Affluence is an affliction that starts in the home.</h2>
				
				<p>This last device produces an intensely brilliant far-reaching white light, but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained by mining in one of several widely separated and remote localities it is seldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for today, and whose hatred for manual labor has kept them in a semi-barbaric state for countless ages.</p>
				
				<h3>A brief interlude set in H3</h3>
				<p>After Sola had replenished my coverings I again slept, nor did I awaken until daylight.  The other occupants of the room, five in number, were all females, and they were still sleeping, piled high with a motley array of silks and furs.  Across the threshold lay stretched the sleepless guardian brute, just as I had last seen him on the preceding day; apparently he had not moved a muscle; his eyes were fairly glued upon me, and I fell to wondering just what might befall me should I endeavor to escape.</p>
				
				<p>I have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone.  It therefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the exact attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room. I felt fairly secure in my belief that I could escape him should he pursue me once I was outside the building, for I had begun to take great pride in my ability as a jumper.  Furthermore, I could see from the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper and probably no runner.</p>
				
				<p>Slowly and carefully, therefore, I gained my feet, only to see that my watcher did the same; cautiously I advanced toward him, finding that by moving with a shuffling gait I could retain my balance as well as make reasonably rapid progress.  As I neared the brute he backed cautiously away from me, and when I had reached the open he moved to one side to let me pass.  He then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces in my rear as I made my way along the deserted street.</p>
